# PostgreSQL Data Types - Complete Guide

## Numeric Data Types

### SMALLINT
I use this when I need to store small whole numbers ranging from -32,768 to 32,767. I choose this to save storage space when I know my values won't exceed this range, like storing ages or quantities in small batches.

### INTEGER (INT)
I use this for standard whole number storage. It ranges from about -2 billion to 2 billion. I pick this as my default choice for IDs, counts, and most numeric calculations since it's the most commonly used integer type.

### BIGINT
I use this when I need to store very large whole numbers beyond the INTEGER range, going up to about 9 quintillion. I choose this for things like large transaction amounts or astronomical measurements.

### DECIMAL (NUMERIC)
I use this for precise decimal numbers where I need exact accuracy. I pick this for financial data, prices, or any calculations where rounding errors would cause problems.

### REAL
I use this for floating-point numbers that don't need extreme precision. I choose this for scientific calculations or measurements where some rounding is acceptable.

### DOUBLE PRECISION
I use this for high-precision floating-point numbers. I pick this when I need more accuracy than REAL but don't need exact decimal precision.

## Character Data Types

### CHAR(n)
I use this for fixed-length strings. I choose this when I know the exact length, like country codes or postal codes.

### VARCHAR(n)
I use this for variable-length strings with a maximum limit. I pick this for names, emails, or descriptions where length varies.

### TEXT
I use this for unlimited variable-length strings. I choose this for long content like articles, comments, or any text without a predictable length limit.

## Boolean Data Type

### BOOLEAN
I use this to store true/false values. I pick this for flags, switches, or yes/no questions in my database.

## Date and Time Data Types

### DATE
I use this to store only dates without time. I choose this for birthdays, event dates, or any calendar-based information.

### TIME
I use this to store only time values without dates. I pick this for working hours, time windows, or time-only information.

### TIMESTAMP
I use this to store both date and time together. I choose this for logging events, recording when actions occurred, or any timestamped information.

### INTERVAL
I use this to store durations or differences between timestamps. I pick this for storing time periods, durations, or calculating differences.

## JSON Data Types

### JSON
I use this to store JSON formatted data. I choose this when I need to store semi-structured data that might have varying fields.

### JSONB
I use this for binary JSON storage. I pick this over JSON because it's faster, allows indexing, and removes duplicate keys.

## UUID Data Type

### UUID
I use this to store universally unique identifiers. I choose this for generating globally unique IDs without depending on sequences.

## Array Data Types

### Array Types (INTEGER[], TEXT[], etc.)
I use these to store arrays of values of a single type. I pick this when I need to store multiple related values in a single column.

## Special Data Types

### BYTEA
I use this to store binary data like images or files. I choose this when I need to store raw binary content in the database.

### SERIAL
I use this for auto-incrementing integers. I pick this for creating primary keys that automatically increment.

### MONEY
I use this for currency values. I choose this for financial applications where I need currency-aware storage.
