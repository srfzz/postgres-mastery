#SCHEMA
Think of a Schema as a folder and a Table as a file inside that folder.
In a professional environment, we don't just dump everything in the default "public" schema. we organize them.

#TO CREATE SCHEMA WE USE 
`` CREATE SCHEMA (schema_name);``
#TO CHCEK IF SCHEMA IS CREATED WE USE THE \DN COMMND IN THE PSQL Terminal
#TO DROP A SCHEMA WE USE 
``DROP SCHEMA (schem_name)``
#TO AGAIN CHCEK IF IT WORKED ON NOT LIKE ITS DELETED OR NOT WE USE 
``\dn commnd in the terminal``
#\dn commnd means List All Schema 


#How to create a Table inside that Schema
``CREATE TABLE management.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);``
#What this does:

1.management.users: Tells Postgres exactly which "folder" to put the table in.

1.SERIAL PRIMARY KEY: Automatically gives each user a unique ID (1, 2, 3...).

2.VARCHAR: Standard text type (like string in Java or Laravel).

3.NOT NULL: Means the field cannot be empty.
