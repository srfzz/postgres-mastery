Phase 1: Basic (Filtering, Sorting, and Simple Joins)
Focus: SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, ORDER BY, and INNER JOIN.

List all actors' first and last names from the actor table.

Find all films with a rental rate of $4.99.

List all films that are rated 'G'.

Find all customers whose last name starts with 'A'.

Find the titles of all films that have a replacement cost between $15 and $20.

List all unique release years from the film table.

Display the first 10 rows of the rental table sorted by rental date descending.

Get the names of all cities in 'India' (requires joining city and country).

Find all films that do not have a rating of 'R'.

List the titles of films and their category names (join film, film_category, and category).

Phase 2: Medium (Aggregations and Grouping)
Focus: GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, and Subqueries.

Count how many films are in each rating category (G, PG, R, etc.).

Find the total number of films each actor has appeared in.

Which category has the most films?

Calculate the total revenue generated by each staff member (join payment and staff).

List customers who have made more than 30 rentals.

Find the average length (duration) of films for each category.

Identify the top 5 countries with the most customers.

Find the total amount paid by each customer, but only for those who spent over $150.

Which film has been rented the most times?

Find all films that have never been rented (requires LEFT JOIN and checking for NULL).

Phase 3: Hard (Complex Logic and Data Transformation)
Focus: CTEs (WITH), Window Functions, and Case Statements.

Window Function: Rank customers in each store based on their total spending.

Case Statement: Categorize films as 'Short' (<60m), 'Medium' (60-120m), and 'Long' (>120m) and count them.

CTE: Create a CTE to find the average rental duration, then select films that are longer than that average.

Find the monthly revenue growth (comparing this month's revenue to last month).

Self-Join: Find pairs of actors who have worked together in more than 3 movies.

Identify the "Store Manager" names and their store's total sales in one result set.

Which inventory items are currently "out" (rented but not yet returned)?

Find the day of the week with the highest number of rentals.

Determine the "Customer Lifetime Value" (total spend since their first rental).

Select the top 3 most rented films in each category (use DENSE_RANK()).

Phase 4: Advanced (Performance & Architecture)
Focus: Query Optimization, Views, and Explain Plans.

Write a query to find "Duplicate Customers" (same first and last name but different IDs).

View Creation: Create a View called sales_by_film_category and query it.

Explain Plan: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on a complex join and identify the "Sequential Scan" vs "Index Scan."

Data Integrity: Write a query to find if there are any addresses that aren't linked to any customers or stores.

JSON Handling: (If your version of Pagila has it) Extract a specific key from a JSONB column.
